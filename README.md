# Flamingo-

![](img/d.png)

Inspired by the song "Flamingo" by Kero Kero Bonito, I created a satisfying visual where it's interactive for the user to follow the tempo of the song by hovering over the cicle. A way to kill time one could say or a way to be satisfied. This was made so I can get the song out of my head.

Done just with HTMl and CSS3
