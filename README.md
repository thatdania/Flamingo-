# Flamingo

![](img/d.png)

Inspired by the song "Flamingo" by Kero Kero Bonito, I created a satisfying visual where it's interactive for the user to follow the tempo of the song by hovering over the cicle. A way to kill time one could say or a way to be satisfied. This was made so I can get the song out of my head.

Done just with HTMl and CSS3

# Steps

1. Clone the project on your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/thatdania/Flamingo-Css.git
```

2. change into the project directory, to the image folder 
```
cd Flamingo/img
```

3.Run the website by opening the html file. 
```
open circle.html 
```
4. Have fun by killing as much time as you want to. Follow the tempo when you hover over the circles.
