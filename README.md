# Flamingo

![](img/d.png)

Inspired by the song "Flamingo" by Kero Kero Bonito, I created a satisfying visual where it's interactive for the user to follow the tempo of the song by hovering over the cicle. A way to kill time one could say or a way to be satisfied. This was made so I can get the song out of my head.

Done just with HTMl and CSS3

##Steps

```
1. Pull down the code or git clone in to your Desktop
```

```
2. Open the youtube link and wait till you open the website (pause it)
```

```
3. Open circle.html in the img folder.
```

```
4. Have fun killing time or kill as much time as you want to.
```
